### Hi! I am Alisa Tian.


- 🌱 I’m currently studying Data Science at Duke University
- 🔭 I’m currently learning Machine Learning, Data Engineering System, Natural Language Processing, Causal Inference
- 📫 How to reach me: alisa.tian@duke.edu
- ⛸️ Fun fact: I love figure skating and skate for Duke Figure Skating Team and Yale Figure Skating Team. 

If I'm not studying, you will possibly find me spinning in the ice rink, stretching in the ballet class, making latte art, designing flora arrangement, or wandering through the art gallery.
